Welcome to Cobra Stock Analysis.

Cobra is a basic application which allows users to consult/analyse/model stock times-series. 

It sources online data but performs optimally with downloaded data.

Cobra offers you the  possibility of searching for specific stocks, and query specified time ranges, 
along with associated analysis, such as statistical descriptions of prices and/or volume (mean, median, range, etc), 
technical indicators, visualisation (of the raw data, but also of transformations, such as moving averages), 
and even basic modelling (such as regression).

To use Cobra, please select what you want to do using the numbered options provided to you at the main menu.
